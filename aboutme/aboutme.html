        <p style="font-size:30px;color:white;"> I'm a kind of person who is not very feared of change and more over tries to experience and bets out of it. I've always been explorer perosn who wants to try out new places, food, adventure activites and love making experiences and learnings with them. It is in this process that I was exposed to Monk Idealogy and way of life which I felt was amazing ans regularly spend time in knowking myself more and try to implement the monk ways in my daily life. Also, entreprenurship is one such thing that hold me up for long time learning and trying it was a interesting journey...so experience, learn and have fun in the journey is what I feel...</p>
